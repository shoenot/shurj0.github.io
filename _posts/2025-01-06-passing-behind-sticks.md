I wanted to run the numbers on how each of the teams in the 2024 season perform when passing to receivers behind the Line of Scrimmage. Here are two tables that compile the data on all such passes.   
   
The first table summarizes passes to all eligible receivers behind the LoS (i.e. less than 0 air yards).

{% include epa_behind.html %}

This second table selects only such passes completed to **Running Backs**.

{% include rb_epa_behind.html %}
